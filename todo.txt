- Add a kill count/score
	- Global and local
- Add highscores
- Add cool randomized messages for attacks, kills, and such
- Add/finish info and help commands
- Make the 'play as guest' option actually work
- Don't ask about saving after dying, make it automatic
- Add a minimum password length

Fix:
- help doesn't work for attacks
- kick and punch upgrades are no longer used (make a upgrades dictionary)
- put the Attack class in another file and get rid of the combo class
